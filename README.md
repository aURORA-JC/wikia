## Things that need work:
- Expression variants - need an automated way to apply the expressions to the full res skins so each expression can be viewed on the full skin
- Multi-layer skins - some skins come separated into two or more layers, need to find a way to automatically combine these layers with the correct sizing and placement, currently unknown how the game lines them up
- Text for voice lines - need an automated way to extract and populate .jsons with the CN/JP/EN text for character voice lines
